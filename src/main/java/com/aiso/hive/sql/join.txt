•只支持等值join

•SELECT a.* FROM a JOIN b ON (a.id = b.id)

•SELECT a.* FROM a JOIN b
    ON (a.id = b.id AND a.department = b.department)

•可以 join 多于 2 个表，例如

SELECT a.val, b.val, c.val FROM a JOIN b
    ON (a.key = b.key1) JOIN c ON (c.key = b.key2)



•如果join中多个表的 join key 是同一个，则 join 会被转化为单个 map/reduce 任务

Hive不支持等值连接

•SQL中对两表内联可以写成：

select * from dual a,dual b where a.key = b.key;

•Hive中应为

select * from dual a join dual b on a.key = b.key;

而不是传统的格式：

SELECT t1.a1 as c1, t2.b1 as c2FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.a2 = t2.b2
